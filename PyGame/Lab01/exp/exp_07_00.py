# Pygame â€“ Time
# While using pygame we sometimes need to perform certain operations 
# that include the usage of time. Like finding how much time our program has been running, 
# pausing the program for an amount of time, etc. For operations of this kind, 
# we need to use the time methods of pygame. In this article, we will be discussing the various methods 
# that can be used for performing these operations.

# The function that we will discuss are:-

# pygame.time.wait
# pygame.time.get_ticks
# pygame.time.delay
# pygame.time.Clock
